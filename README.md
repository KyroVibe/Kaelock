Idk, some game or something. Trying to learn some more CMake and game engine stuff.

### Building
Best of luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor...

Download `glfw` and `glew-2.2.0`, and put them inside of `Bratva/Deps/`

GLFW Repo: `https://github.com/glfw/glfw`
GLEW Download: `https://github.com/nigels-com/glew/releases/download/glew-2.2.0/glew-2.2.0.zip`
